apache2.conf is the main configuration
file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
files when starting up the web server.



ports.conf is always included from the
main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.



Configuration files in the mods-enabled/,
conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.



They are activated by symlinking available
configuration files from their respective
*-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
by using our helpers

a2enmod,
a2dismod,


a2ensite,
a2dissite,

and

a2enconf,
a2disconf
. See their respective man pages for detailed information.



The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.
Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
default configuration.
